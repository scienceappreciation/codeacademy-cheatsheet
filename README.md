# CodeAcademy: HTML5 Cheatsheet
## My own personal cheatsheet created for CodeAcademy.

### How to Use:
Click Code > Download Zip and open index.html in your browser of choice. Enjoy!

### Brief Context
I was given open ended instructions to create a cheatsheet which has the contents of my choosing with the restriction of having to use tables, a custom color scheme with the color keywords, and having to assign a special background to code. I included the elements I struggle to remember and an example of how to use them.
